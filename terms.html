<h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

<p>You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to The Modern Multilingual.</br>

  <br>The Modern Multilingual is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</br>

  <br>The app does use third party services that declare their own Terms and Conditions. For more information, please view our privacy policy. </br>

  <br>Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but The Modern Multilingual cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</br>

  <br>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on iOS – the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. The Modern Multilingual does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you.</br>

  <br>We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</br>

<h2> Changes to Terms and Conditions</h2> 
<p> You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Any updates will be posted on this page. 
  <br>This current policy is effective as of 2021-01-01.</br>
