<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>By using this app you are consenting to our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information set out in this privacy policy. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described:</p>

<h2>Information Collection and AdMob 📱</h2>
<p>
This app is an Ad Supported app and its services are provided by The Modern Multilingual at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This app uses Google's AdMob advertising service which collects anonymous information in accordance to its advertising privacy policies. Google may use the advertising ID from the device on which the ad is serving to generate data which may be used to serve better targeted ads to you as the user. AdMob's privacy policy is available at https://policies.google.com/privacy

To complement personalized advertising, Google’s Ads Settings lets users view and edit their interests and demographics. You can opt out of personalised ads by changing your Ads Settings.
</p>

<h2> Cookies 🍪 </h2> 
<p>
Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.
This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. Third party code (in this case, AdMob) may use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies via your browser settings and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. 
</p>

<h2> Links to Other Sites 🔗</h2>
<p>
By clicking on ads, you will be directed to third party websites. Note that these external sites are not operated by this app and we have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
</p>
  
<h2> Log Data 📖</h2>
<p> 
In cases of errors or app crashes, log data is collected in order to obtain more information and diagnose application issues. Log data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, operating system version, the time and date of the use of the app, and other statistics which will help in identifying and fixing any bugs.
</p>
  
<h2>Email 📧 </h2> 
<p> 
If you email the developer for support or other feedback, your email address will be used only to reply to the concerns or suggestions raised and will never be used for any marketing purpose.
</p>

<h2> Children’s Privacy 👶 </h2> 
<p>  
This app is not intended for very young children, especially since we cannot control the types of advertisements presented to the user. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.
</p>

  
<h2> Changes to This Privacy Policy </h2> 
<p> 
You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Any updates will be posted on this page.
